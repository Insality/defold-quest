# Disclaimer

The library in development stage. May be not fully tested and README may be not full. If you have any questions, please, create an issue. This library is an adoptation of [Quest](https://github.com/Insality/defold-eva/blob/master/eva/modules/quest.lua) module from my [Defold-Eva](https://github.com/Insality/defold-eva) library.


# Quest

**Quest** - module is a comprehensive system for managing quests in a game. It allows for the registration, tracking, and completion of quests, with various events and callbacks to handle quest-related activities.


## Features

- **Quest Management** - Create, start, and complete quests with ease.
- **Quest Progress** - Track the progress of quests and their tasks.
- **Quest Events** - Listen for quest-related events and adjust it for your needs.


## Setup

### [Dependency](https://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/)

Open your `game.project` file and add the following line to the dependencies field under the project section:

**[Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/defold-event/archive/refs/tags/5.zip
```

**[Defold Quest](https://github.com/Insality/defold-quest/archive/refs/tags/1.zip)**

```
https://github.com/Insality/defold-quest/archive/refs/tags/1.zip
```

After that, select `Project ‚ñ∏ Fetch Libraries` to update [library dependencies]((https://defold.com/manuals/libraries/#setting-up-library-dependencies)). This happens automatically whenever you open a project so you will only need to do this if the dependencies change without re-opening the project.

### Library Size

> **Note:** The library size is calculated based on the build report per platform

| Platform         | Library Size |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| HTML5            | **3.91 KB**  |
| Desktop / Mobile | **7.57 KB**  |



### Quest Configuration File

Create a configuration file for the Quest module.. Place your configuration file inside your [custom resources folder](https://defold.com/manuals/project-settings/#custom-resources) to ensure they are included in the build.

The configuration file should be a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
	"001_hidden": {
		"autostart": true,
		"autofinish": true,
		"tasks": [
			{ "action": "complete_cell", "object": "141" }
		]
	},
	"002_destroy_them_all": {
		"category": "quest",
		"autostart": true,
		"autofinish": true,
		"required_quests": [ "001_hidden" ],
		"tasks": [
			{ "action": "destroy_object", "object": "tree", "required": 10 }
		]
	}
}
```

> Note: for more quest fields check the `annotations.lua` to see the available properties.

When you have created the configuration file, you can initialize the Quest module with the following code:

```lua
quest.init("/resources/quest_config.json")
```
